        <p>On behalf of the Senior Leadership Team at St. Mary’s I want to extend our congratulations and appreciation to the Stroke and Trauma teams. Both have been very successful in their recent reviews by the Joint Commission and the American College of Surgeons respectively. The stroke survey identified a best practice at St. Mary’s in achieving a 76% follow up rate. The trauma survey identified no deficiencies in our program. <br>
      
        Kudos to the teams in both areas for all the excellent work that has been done to achieve this success. Your work is appreciated by your colleagues and by the patients in our region who depend on us to care for them when they are in need.
        <br><br>
        With appreciation,<br>

          <h2>May Crowning
            St. Mary’s Medical Center
            Tuesday May 7th, 2019
            Outside Entrance 6 at 2:00pm
            </h2>
            <p>“Our” Mary, the Madonna & Child Statue at Entrance 6, will be crowned with a veil of lovely flowers. Please join us at 2pm on Tuesday, May 7th!
              <br> <br>
              The Catholic tradition of venerating the mother of Jesus includes the Coronation of Mary -the May crowning, it's called. The practice, which is not as prevalent as it used to be, goes back to the 16th century and involves the placing of a wreath of flowers on an image of Mary. Mary's role in the Catholic faith is that she is the mother of the Catholic Church.   
              </p>
              <p>St. Mary’s Hospital is excited to be a sponsor of the American Heart Association’s new initiative, CycleNation, a spin bike relay event that is not only fun but also raises money for a great cause. <br>We are hoping to fill at least 5 teams for the inaugural CycleNation Grand Junction event on May 9th! </p>
              <h4>Here is what you need to know about CycleNation:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>CycleNation is taking over Grand Junction on May 9th from 5:30pm-9pm at Colorado Mesa University.  Here is a video about CycleNation to get you excited: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VNL0BST4TA</li>
                <li>Our mission as a team will be to keep our bikes moving from 6:00pm-8:00pm (each person rides for 30 minutes) and then to celebrate heart and brain health with awards for the companies involved from 8:00-9:00 pm.</li>
                <li>Each team needs 4 riders (each person rides for 30 minutes) and commit to setting a goal to raise $1,000 collectively as a team. (Note this is a goal and not a requirement of participation).</li>
              </ul>
